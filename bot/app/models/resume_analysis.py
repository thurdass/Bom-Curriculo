"""Structured resume contracts, produced directly from resume text by the AI.

Two distinct AI outputs share the same input sources (base CV + LinkedIn +
GitHub/portfolio + reported skills): ``ResumeScoreResult`` just judges the
resume as given, while ``BuiltResumeResult`` reconstructs it into the best
possible ATS-optimized version. Field names and shapes mirror the Laravel
consumer's expected payload exactly (``header/experiences/projects/...``) so
the response can be persisted without any renaming step on the PHP side.
