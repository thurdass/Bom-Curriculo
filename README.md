# Bom Currículo - ATS Resume Builder

https://bomcurriculo.tech

## UNDER CONSTRUCTION - EM CONSTRUÇÃO

Build ATS-friendly resumes using AI.

## About

Bom Currículo is an open-source project that generates professional resumes optimized for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).

The system can use multiple optional sources of information, including:

- Current resume
- LinkedIn Profile (PDF export)
- GitHub profile
- Portfolio
- Personal information
- Target job description

The user does not need to provide every source. The only requirement is enough information to generate a resume.

## Features

- LinkedIn profile analysis
- GitHub profile analysis
- Portfolio analysis
- Job description matching
- ATS-friendly resume generation
- Resume optimization

## Screen prototype

An initial interface prototype was also developed in Figma to validate the user experience, feature organization, and the platform's main flow before final implementation.

The screen is still evolving, but it already represents the first visual proposal of the user dashboard, including:

- ATS score overview;
- General resume performance indicator;
- AI-powered optimization tips;
- List of uploaded resumes;
- Application progress tracking;
- Sidebar menu with access to the platform’s main areas.


> **Note:** the design is still under development and may be adjusted as the product evolves.
